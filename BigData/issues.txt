Issue 1: Incorrect centroid initialization

    Description: The original centroid initialization method using distances and probabilities didn't run as expected.
    
    Solution: Revised the centroid initialization logic to calculate distances using the minimum distance to existing centroids 
    and properly normalize these distances to select new centroids.

Issue 2: Handling "Mean of empty slice" RuntimeWarning

    Description: During centroid reassignment, some clusters had no points assigned to them, 
    resulting in the np.mean() function operating on an empty list and producing NaN values.
    
    Solution: Modified the code to skip updating centroids for clusters with no points. 
    A conditional check was added to retain the previous centroid for empty clusters, 
    avoiding calculations on empty lists and preventing the "Mean of empty slice" warning.

Overview of Changes Made:

    Adjusted centroid initialization to ensure proper centroid selection based on distances and probabilities.
    Implemented a check during centroid reassignment to skip updating centroids for clusters with no points assigned to them, 
    preventing NaN values and the "Mean of empty slice" warning.
